/*
enums are what we call state value variables 
they are comma separated lists of identifiers
we can use them to create Type or Category variables
meaning each heading of the list is a type or category element that this can be
eg weapons in an inventory are a type of inventory item
if the item is a weapon we can equipt it
if it is a consumable we can drink it
it runs different code depending on what that objects enum is set to
you can also have subtypes within those types
eg weapons are an inventory category or type
we can then have ranged, melee weapons
or daggers, short swords, long swords, mace, axe, great axe, war axe and so on
each Type or Category holds different infomation the game needs like 
what animation plays, where the hands sit on the weapon, how many hands sit on the weapon and so on
